# Dev News

<hr/>
Dev New is a web application I created over a weekend. I wanted to create a site that has my favorite developer news articles. 

You can view the site at ["Dev News"](http://devnews.noip.me/). The site is hosted on Heroku's free tier so the initial page load may take up to 10 seconds. Subsequent page loads will load immediately.  

There are a few things I would like to add but the basic functionality is complete. 

Tech stack: express, nginx, redis, node, jquery, handlebars, eslint
