# rss-reader

<hr/>
Rss-reader is a web application I created over a weekend. I wanted to create a site that has my favorite developer news articles. 

You can view the site at ["Dev News"](https://fav-urls.herokuapp.com/) 

There are a few things I would like to add but the basic functionality is complete. 

Tech stack: express, jquery, node, handlebars, eslint
